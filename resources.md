# Resources

Topological data analysis is a field that has matured quite a bit in the last ten years.  This page will serve as a collection of resources for the course.

## Textbooks

### Required Textbook
* "Persistence Theory: From Quiver Representations to Data Analysis" by Oudot - [[UChicago Library](https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/10444435)]  [[Electronic Resource](https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/12407520)]

We'll use this book as our guide through good portions of the course.  It's more a monograph than a textbook, and some material is more advanced than what we'll cover in this course, but it is as close as we'll get to a single resource. We're going to skip around a bit.

Note that you can download a free electronic copy through the UChicago Library.

### Optional Textbooks
* "Computational topology : an introduction" by Edelsbrunner and Harer - [UChicago Library](https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/7916610)
* "Elementary Applied Topology" by Ghrist - [Free on Author's Website](https://www.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/notes.html)

These two books are good places to start for inspiration, and good references for parts of the course.

### Additional References
* "Algebraic Topology" by Hatcher - [UChicago Library](https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/4595299)
* "Elements of Algebraic Topology" by Munkres - [UChicago Library](https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/7846007)

These books are both graduate-level introductions to algebraic topology.

## Papers

### Review Papers

Review papers are a good place to look for high-level overviews of the field

### Foundations

### Algorithms

### Applications


## Software

### TDA Software

* Dionysus (Python/C++)
* GUDHI (Python/C++)
* BATS (Python/C++)
* Eirene (Julia)
* rtda ( R )
* JavaPlex (Java/MATLAB)
* Perseus (C++)
* Ripser (C++)
* scikit-tda (Python)

### Programming Language Help

I'm planning to use C++ and Python for demonstration purposes.  The goal is to write things in a sensible way so even if you aren't familiar with these languages, you can translate into a language you are familiar with.  The reason for choosing these languages is that they are commonly used in TDA software, and in scientific computing and data analysis more broadly.

For Python help, you might consider looking at the course materials for [CAAM 37830 / STAT 37830](https://caam37830.github.io/).

For C++, I highly recommend the book "From Mathematics to Generic Programming" by Stepanov and Rose.
